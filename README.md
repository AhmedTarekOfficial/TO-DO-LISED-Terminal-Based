The main objective of the to-do list app is to organize the Daily Life Tasks. 
And separate each task either into groups or categories or based on 

How does it work ? 
---------------
When the user runs the program, the main menu will be displayed to him. 
The main menu includes four operations he can do. 

# FIRST - ADDING TASK

When the user clicks on option one which adds a task, it will request from him first to enter the name of the task. 

And enter the Description of the Task that describes what this task is and what the user should do in this task if the user forgets the purpose of it. 
Then, the last thing it will request from him to enter a period for this task. 
If he doesn't enter it, then the task will be forever until he removes it manually. 


After all of this, a file named "Tasks_information.json" will be generated that contains the information about the task. 

Each title of the task represents its description.
